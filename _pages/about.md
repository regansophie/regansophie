Hello! My name is Sophie. I am currently at PhD student at the University of California, Berkeley in Berkeley, California. I work with Prof. Mahesh Srinivasan studying language development. Before coming to Berkeley, I was at Stanford University where I received a B.S. in Symbolic Systems, a B.A. in French, and an M.S. in Symbolic Systems. ([Symbolic Systems](https://symsys.stanford.edu/) is Stanford's equivalent of Cognitive Science)
